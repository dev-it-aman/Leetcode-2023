/**
 * @brief Idea learned from the official solution
 * For a fixed point points[i], consider all other points points[j] and calculate the atan2 for each vector points[j] - points[i] (the vector with the magnitudes (points[j].x - points[i].x, points[j].y - points[i].y)).
 * Then find the maximum number of times some angle value occurs among the calculated values. One can use a hash map for this.
 */

/**
 * @brief Algorithm learned from the official solution
 * For each points[i], maintain a hash map cnt to count the angles.
 * - For each j â‰  i, calculate the atan2 of the vector points[j] - points[i] and add this value to the current hash map.
 * - Let k be the maximum number of occurrences of some angle value in the hash map.
 * - Update the answer with k+1. (+1 because the point points[i] also lies on the line, and we must include it in the answer.)
 */

/**
 * @brief New thing I've learned from this challenge
 * The atan2 built-in function in C++ (https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/atan2/)
 * - double atan2(double y, double x);
 * - Compute arc tangent with two parameters
 * - Returns the principal value of the arc tangent of y/x, expressed in radians.
